 *
 *   - which effect, how long, how many settle frames  → from the settings store
 *   - where the reveal starts                          → the parked touch point
 *   - when NOT to animate                              → Reduce Motion, first paint
 *
 * Copy this file into your own app and delete what you do not need.
