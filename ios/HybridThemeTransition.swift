/**
 * Native theme-change transition for iOS.
 *
 * ── Why it is built this way ──
 * A Unistyles theme change is a whole-app style re-evaluation plus a shadow-tree
 * commit, synchronous on the JS thread. It cannot be animated frame by frame.
 * So the theme swap stays exactly as it is, and the ANIMATION is applied to a
 * copy of the screen instead.
 *
 * The copy is a `UIView.snapshotView(afterScreenUpdates:)`, which is backed by a
 * render-server-side copy — no bitmap is ever read back to the CPU, encoded, or
 * decoded. Earlier attempts at this effect all round-tripped full-screen pixels
 * through JavaScript, and that latency is what made them feel laggy.
 *
 * Every animation here is UIKit/Core Animation. Once submitted they are
 * interpolated by the render server, so a busy (or blocked) JS thread cannot
 * drop a frame of them.
 *
 * ── What is captured, and where the copies live ──
 * The capture is a snapshot of the app's WHOLE WINDOW, and the copies are hosted
 * in a separate window one level above it:
 *
 *     overlay window (ours)
 *       ├─ snapshot A   ← oldest change, TOP-most, animating away to reveal B
 *       └─ snapshot B   ← next change, animating away to reveal the live app
 *     app window
 *       ├─ presentation container   ← a Modal, a sheet, an alert
 *       └─ rootViewController.view  ← live app, already on the newest theme
 *
 * Both halves of that arrangement are load-bearing.
 *
 * Capturing the WINDOW rather than `rootViewController.view` is what makes
 * modals work. A presented view controller is not inside the root view — UIKit
 * hosts it in a container of its own, whose exact shape is a private detail that
 * has changed across releases. The one thing guaranteed is that if it is on
 * screen in this window, it is in this window's layer tree, so a window-level
 * snapshot cannot miss it. Copying only the root view produced a picture with
 * the modal cut out of it, pinned on top of the live modal — the modal vanished
 * for the length of the animation and reappeared, already re-themed, at the end.
 *
 * Hosting the copies OUTSIDE that window is what keeps the whole-window capture
 * honest: a snapshot must contain the app *without* the other snapshots, or each
 * capture would bake in a frozen copy of the animations still running above it.
 * It also settles z-order for good — UIKit appends a presentation's container to
 * the app window as it is presented, which would otherwise put a modal opened
 * mid-transition on top of the copy meant to be covering it.
 *
 * ── Concurrent transitions ──
 * Switching again before a reveal finishes does NOT cancel anything. Each change
 * gets its own snapshot and its own animation, and they play at the same time.
 * Each snapshot reveals whatever sits directly beneath it, which is exactly the
 * state the app was in one step later. Newer snapshots therefore go BELOW older
 * ones, and the stack stays visually consistent no matter how fast the user taps.
 */

/**
 * Timing shared by every kind, and by both platforms — the Android side uses the
 * same four numbers so the transitions look identical.
 *
 * ── Why not a snappier curve ──
 * This was `(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`, and it front-loads far too much: half the reveal is
 * over by 20% of the duration, 94% by 62%, and the remainder crawls. At 600ms+
 * that reads as "brisk"; at the 200–300ms a production app actually wants, the
 * visible part of the motion collapses into two or three frames and the change
 * looks instant, with a long tail where nothing appears to happen.
 *
 * `(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` spreads the motion out — 50% done at 35% of the duration —
 * so a short transition still reads as movement from one state to another rather
 * than as a cut.

 * being taken apart needs enough frames for the eye to register the shape of the
 * motion, not just its start and end. At 120ms a reveal is six frames — the
 * circle is already half-way in frame two, and what the user sees is a flicker
 * with a hard edge in it.
 *
 * The floors differ because the kinds do not carry the same amount of
 * information. A fade has one moving quantity; a wipe has a moving boundary the
 * eye tracks across the whole screen; `pixlated` has to grow a mosaic, swap the
 * colours behind it, and take the mosaic back down again, so it needs roughly
 * three times a fade to complete that arc.
 *
 * A caller asking for `0` still means "no animation" — the clamp only applies to
 * a genuine request, so an app can always opt out.

 * The geometry behind `slide` and `split`: a straight boundary sweeping across

 * ── One idea, used twice ──
 * Both kinds are "stop drawing the old screen on one side of a line". A wipe has
 * one such line travelling across the whole screen; a split has two, starting
 * together at the middle and parting. Expressing them as half-planes rather than
 * as rectangles is what lets the line be tilted at all — an axis-aligned
 * `clipRect` has no way to say "40° off level".
 *
 * A half-plane is `dot(p, n) >= threshold`, where `n` is a unit normal pointing
 * the way the surviving side lies. Sweeping is then nothing but moving
 * `threshold` from one end of the screen's projection onto `n` to the other:
 * at the low end every corner satisfies it, at the high end none do, whatever
 * the angle. That is the whole reason this generalises for free.
 *
 * Each half-plane comes back as a four-point quad. That matters on this platform
 * specifically: Core Animation interpolates a `path` animation point by point,
 * so as long as the two endpoints have the same structure — and they do, since
 * only `threshold` differs — the sweep is submitted once and interpolated by the
 * render server, with nothing running per frame.

   * `measureInWindow` reports positions in the sheet's surface, so every value
   * available to the app is already in the wrong space. Measured on an iPhone 16
   * Pro: `page 213,380`, `measureInWindow 158,371` — the same offset, the sheet's
   * own origin, missing from both.
   *
   * The presentation's frame is the missing term, and only UIKit knows it. It is
   * read fresh for every capture, so dragging the sheet between detents needs no
   * special handling — the offset is simply whatever the sheet's frame is at the
   * moment the user touched it.
   *
