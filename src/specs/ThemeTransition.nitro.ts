/**
 * Which animation plays as the old screen is taken away.
 *
 * None of them costs JavaScript work. Most are submitted to the OS once and
 * interpolated by the render thread, so even a blocked JS thread cannot stutter
 * them; `pixlated` is the exception, since its two mosaics have to be
 * cross-faded against each other frame by frame.
 *
 *   fade            opacity to zero
 *   circularReveal  the old screen collapsing into a circle at `origin`
 *   circularRevealInverse
 *                   a hole opening at `origin` and growing outward — the same
 *                   shape as `circularReveal`, run the other way round
 *   slide           a straight edge sweeping across, uncovering the new theme
 *                   (a mask wipe — nothing on screen actually moves). The edge
 *                   can be tilted with `angleDeg`
 *   split           the same edge, but TWO of them, parting from the centre —
 *                   the old screen retreats to both opposite edges at once
 *   blur            the old screen blurs as it goes — either all at once or
 *                   swept along `direction`, see `blurStyle`
 *   pixlated        dual mosaic crossfade — colour swaps mid-transition behind
 *                   the pixels (Skia `pixelize` look, CPU mosaic on both platforms)
 *   dissolve        the old screen disintegrates into grain — cells drop out in
 *                   a fixed noise order until nothing is left
 *   iris            `circularReveal` with a shape other than a circle — see
 *                   `shape`
 *   barnDoor        `split` run the other way: two edges close IN to the centre,
 *                   so the old screen survives as a shrinking middle band
 *   blinds          `bands` parallel slabs, each wiping across itself in unison
 *   stripes         `dissolve`'s grain, ordered along `direction` instead of at
 *                   random — a grainy edge sweeping across
 *   ripple          concentric wavefronts expanding from `origin`
 *   shatter         the screen breaks into cells that fall away in random order
 *   zoom            the old screen scales up and fades
 *   liquidGlass     a sheet of Liquid Glass slides down over the screen, the
 *                   theme changes behind it while it holds, and then it slides
 *                   back up.
 *                   iOS 26+; every other platform and version falls back to
 *                   `blur`, which is the closest material there is
