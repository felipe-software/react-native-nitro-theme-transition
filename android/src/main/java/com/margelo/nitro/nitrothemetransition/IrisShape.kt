/**
 * The outlines `iris` collapses the old screen into. The counterpart of
 * `IrisShape` in `ios/HybridThemeTransition.swift` — keep the two in step, or
 * the platforms stop matching.
 *
 * ── Why they are all polygons ──
 * `circularReveal` animates a path from a big circle to a tiny one, and on iOS
 * Core Animation interpolates that point by point. Anything `iris` draws has to
 * survive the same treatment, which rules out arcs and rounded-rect helpers: the
 * number of segments those emit depends on the radius, so the two endpoints
 * would not match and the interpolation would produce garbage.
 *
 * So every shape here is a fixed-vertex polygon on the unit circle, scaled by
 * the radius. Android redraws the path per frame and would not care either way,
 * but the two platforms share the definition so they share the look.
 *
 * Points are stored flat — `[x0, y0, x1, y1, …]` — to keep the per-frame path
 * build allocation-free.
