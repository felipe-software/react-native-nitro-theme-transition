/**
 * A frozen copy of the app, drawn with a clip that shrinks over the transition.
 *
 * ── Why a copy at all ──
 * A Unistyles theme change is a whole-app style re-evaluation plus a shadow-tree
 * commit, synchronous on the JS thread. It cannot be animated frame by frame. So
 * the theme swap stays exactly as it is, and the ANIMATION runs on a copy of the
 * screen laid over the live app.
 *
 * ── Why the copy has to be rasterized ──
 * The obvious capture — record the view into a [RenderNode] with
 * `view.draw(recordingCanvas)` — DOES NOT WORK, and fails in a way that looks
 * like the animation is broken rather than the capture.
 *
 * `View.draw(Canvas)` delegates to `dispatchDraw` → `drawChild`, and on a
 * hardware canvas each child is emitted as `drawRenderNode(child.renderNode)` —
 * a REFERENCE to the child's live RenderNode, not a copy of its pixels. The
 * result is a live mirror of the app: the moment the theme changes, the
 * "snapshot" changes with it. Every mask, clip and opacity animation then plays
 * over content identical to what is underneath, so nothing appears to happen at
 * all — except `blur`, where the effect itself is visible even though it is
 * blurring the wrong frame.
 *
 * So the recording is only step one. Step two renders it into an offscreen
 * surface with [HardwareRenderer], which resolves every referenced RenderNode
 * into actual pixels, and the resulting [HardwareBuffer] is wrapped as a hardware
 * [Bitmap]. That bitmap is a genuine frozen frame, it lives in GPU memory, and it
 * is never read back to the CPU — the Android counterpart of iOS's
 * `snapshotView(afterScreenUpdates:)`.
 *
 * Below API 29 there is no public `HardwareRenderer`, so it falls back to a
 * software `Canvas` — which rasterizes for the same reason, since a software
 * canvas cannot reference RenderNodes and has to draw the pixels. That costs one
 * full-screen software draw at capture time; the animation itself is GPU-side
 * either way.

   *    or closes it outright — see the pool for which, and why.

/**
 * Keeps the offscreen surfaces a capture needs, instead of building them anew

 * ── Why ──
 * Each capture used to allocate its own [ImageReader] and [HardwareRenderer].
 * The reader is the expensive half: at 1080x2400 its buffer is ~10 MB of
 * graphics memory, allocated and mapped on the UI thread inside the synchronous
 * window that `begin()` holds the JS thread open for. One theme change absorbs
 * that; a user flicking the toggle pays it over and over, which is exactly when
 * the drop is most visible.
 *
 * Since the screen size does not change between captures, a returned lease is
 * almost always the right shape for the next one.
 *
 * ── Why it does not simply grow ──
 * Idle leases are graphics memory doing nothing, so only full-screen-ish ones
 * are worth keeping ([MIN_POOLED_PIXELS] — the grid-sized ones `pixlated` uses
 * are cheap to rebuild), at most [MAX_IDLE] of them, and the lot is destroyed
 * once the app has gone [TRIM_DELAY_MS] without a theme change.
 *
 * Main thread only, like everything else here.
